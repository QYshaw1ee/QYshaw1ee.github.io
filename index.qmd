Here is me after the Barbie Movie, 

I personally think the movie reconnected me to see how LIFE is BEAUTIFUL because it is full of Ups and Downs.

 It sounds funny how someone may see life as such and call it beauty, but I can assure you its what makes me Unique!

Ps. The files are many and messy, but with the help of my prof, I managed to have some form of organisation, lol \^\_\^

Thank you Prof!
