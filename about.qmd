This site was birthed as part of my nm2207 course and I much appreciate this skill we are learning. I hope to add many more projects and improve my website building skills :)

#### I am a year 2 Political Science and Anthropology student!

"Why political science and Anthropology?" you may ask. 

Well, I appreciate understanding human culture and what makes a person unique and I believe good policies can help improve people's lives so that they can experience improvements in their lives. 

Which is probably why most of the stuff I write about (like my NM2207 Project) involves some kind of investigation and perhaps some recommendations to improve the situation! I find this my way of helping people :)

#### Focus on the Positivity of things
